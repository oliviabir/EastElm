Describe the problem
I'm recieving this error message:
Error: Can't use 'tar -xzf' extract archive file: /home/runner/work/_actions/_temp_01f0cbeb-59d1-4b0f-850d-bb6cf5eab67b/a7ec2058-daf3-4f67-845f-2daafe20ec6a.tar.gz. return code: 2.
This is happening right at set up job. I've been consistently pushing to heroku throughout the process and haven't had any issues. I did not add any files, only code so I'm not sure what it's trying to extract

Adding the email_validator package for wtforms to Pipfile/requirements

I had to install the email_validator package for wtforms email validation to work and forgot to add to a file for heroku to load it. I think I need the version to add this to the Pipfile and I am unable to find the version

I am getting an Application Error on Heroku as I pushed without adding the necessary package. In my Heroku logs it says 'app crashed' at= error

What have you done to debug? / What have you searched/tried?
I've tried searching for the version for the email_validator package as well as looking at the wtforms docs but haven't found anything to this effect

Relevant code snippets/screenshots with explanations

Hey Whit! Was hoping to clarify that I properly addressed one of the issues you mentioned on my scorecard. Overall everything was very straightforward but concerning "For this landing page, there is no explanation/welcome message that explains what this app is. This can easily be put below the nav bar/links." I was wondering if this is satisfactory?
