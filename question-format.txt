What are you working on?
Pushing to github to deploy to heroku, reviews branch
Describe the problem
I'm recieving this error message:
Error: Can't use 'tar -xzf' extract archive file: /home/runner/work/_actions/_temp_01f0cbeb-59d1-4b0f-850d-bb6cf5eab67b/a7ec2058-daf3-4f67-845f-2daafe20ec6a.tar.gz. return code: 2.
This is happening right at set up job. I've been consistently pushing to heroku throughout the process and haven't had any issues. I did not add any files, only code so I'm not sure what it's trying to extract
What have you done to debug? / What have you searched/tried?
I've googled the error message but everything that come is people who are trying to upload zip files
Relevant code snippets/screenshots with explanations (crop, mark-up, or explain them)

What are you working on?
Adding the email_validator package for wtforms to Pipfile/requirements

Describe the problem
I had to install the email_validator package for wtforms email validation to work and forgot to add to a file for heroku to load it. I think I need the version to add this to the Pipfile and I am unable to find the version

What error messages do you have?
I am getting an Application Error on Heroku as I pushed without adding the necessary package. In my Heroku logs it says 'app crashed' at= error

What have you done to debug? / What have you searched/tried?
I've tried searching for the version for the email_validator package as well as looking at the wtforms docs but haven't found anything to this effect

Relevant code snippets/screenshots with explanations

Branch: reviews

What are you working on? (give us some context)
In testing sign-up again I noticed that it will go through with the signup even with the repeated password not matching the original. I attempted to use the EqualTo validator built in to wtforms and I thought it was working, but when testing again it now blocks all signup even with repeated password filled in.

Describe the problem (what are you trying to do? what is it currently doing?)
While trying to figure out what the issue is I moved the EqualTo validator to 'repeat_password' and added a dataRequired validator. Once I added that I realized the issue is that the info in that input field is not being captured although I changed nothing about that from the starter. I haven't seen any differences between that field and the others.

What error messages do you have? (screenshot or copy)
No console error messages. I tried console logging in the handleSubmit but it just confirms that the repeat_password field is not being captured at all. I haven't changed anything related to the input itself from the starter we were given.

What have you done to debug? / What have you searched/tried?
I've gone through each page in vscode that data would hit, ensured I added repeat_password to the thunk in the store so that info is being sent back, but it's not even capturing it in front-end error handling. I've tried googling but I'm not seeing anything relevant now but I'm going to continue with that and console logging.
